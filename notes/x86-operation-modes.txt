The x86 processor model has 3 primary operating modes. These are as follows:

1. Protected Mode
2. Real Address Mode
3. System Management Mode

The protected mode has a sub-category known as the "Virtual - 8086 mode" 
(virtual 8086 mode (also called virtual real mode, V86-mode, or VM86). This 
mode allows the execution of real mode applications that are incapable of 
directly running in protected mode while the processor is running in that mode.
It is a hardware virtualization technique that allowed multiple 8086 processors
to be emulated by the 386 chip. 

===============================================================================
============================= Protected Mode ==================================
===============================================================================

    - This is the native state of the processor.
    - All instruction features are available in this mode. 
    - Includes the VM86 sub-mode.
    - Projects are given seperate memory areas called segments. 
    - Processor prevents program from referencing outside of their assigned
      segment. 

    - NOTE: The VM86 mode actually enables the processor to directly execute 
            real-address mode software while in Protected mode.


===============================================================================
================================ Real Mode=====================================
===============================================================================

    - Implements 8086 programming environment.
    - Capable of switching into other modes.
    - This is where the bootloader and initial kernel stuff happens

===============================================================================
=========================== System Management Mode ============================
===============================================================================

SMM, sometimes called ringâˆ’2 in reference to protection rings. This is where we
have stuff like device drivers. The mode is primarily used to provide the OS a
way to manage the system

So, simply put, according to the x86 architecture, here's a list of stuff that
runs on the different privilege rings:

    - Ring 0 (most privileged):
        - Kernel mode
        - Device drivers
        - Hypervisors

    - Ring 1:
        - Not typically used in modern operating systems

    - Ring 2:
        - Legacy drivers
        - System management mode (SMM)

    - Ring 3 (least privileged):
        - User mode applications
        - User mode drivers

Ring 1 is not typically used in most modern operating systems because it offers 
little advantage over Ring 2 in terms of performance or security. In fact, 
using Ring 1 requires additional overhead for context switching, and there is 
little need for privileged instructions that can only be executed at Ring 1. 
Additionally, Ring 1 has historically been used by virtual machine hypervisors 
to run virtual machine guest operating systems, but modern virtualization 
technologies use hardware-assisted virtualization which allows guest operating
systems to run directly on Ring 0 without the need for Ring 1.
