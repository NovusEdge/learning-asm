Machine instructions generally fall into 3 categories:
1. Data movement
2. Arithmetic/logical
3. Control Flow

We use the following notation:

    <reg32>     Any 32-bit register (EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, ESI, EDI, ESP, or EBP)
    <reg16>     Any 16-bit register (AX, BX, CX, or DX)
    <reg8> 	    Any 8-bit register (AH, BH, CH, DH, AL, BL, CL, or DL)
    <reg> 	    Any register
    	
    <mem> 	    A memory address (e.g., [eax], [var + 4], or dword ptr [eax+ebx])
    <con32> 	Any 32-bit constant
    <con16> 	Any 16-bit constant
    <con8> 	    Any 8-bit constant
    <con> 	    Any 8-, 16-, or 32-bit constant

For each of the movement instructions, see the movement-instructions.asm file

For each of the arithmetic/logical instructions, see the 
logical-instructions.asm file

For each of the control-flow instructions, see the cf-instructions.asm file
